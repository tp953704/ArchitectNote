Danny Cohen, who was director of television at the BBC from 2013 to 2015, has compiled a report accusing the corporation of making ‚Äúfalse and damaging claims about Israel‚Äôs conduct of this war‚Äù and producing ‚Äúmisleading broadcasts and social media output‚Äù. The Board of Deputies of British Jews, the Jewish Leadership Council, and the Community Security Trust, a charity that combats extremism and antisemitism, have backed the report. They argued in a joint statement that coverage has ‚Äúled many British Jews to conclude that the BBC has become institutionally hostile to Israel‚Äù. ‚Ä¢ Israel begins ground offensive against Hezbollah Loading Title...
