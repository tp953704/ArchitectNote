Additionally, Cypress offers features such as network request mocking, automatic testing of forms and input fields, and a powerful dashboard that provides real-time feedback during tests.\\n\\nSelenium WebDriver, on the other hand, is more flexible but can be complex to set up and maintain, especially in larger projects.

These traces can help identify issues in your tests or the behavior of the web application itself. Additionally, Playwright supports headless execution, which means you can run tests without a browser UI, making it easier to automate and integrate into continuous integration pipelines.\\n\\nIn summary, Playwright handles network interception by allowing you to inspect network requests, and it aids debugging through tracing features that provide detailed logs and visualizations of test runs.',\n",

These tools help in verifying that data is being processed and returned correctly without involving actual user interfaces.\\n\\nBrowser automation tools like Selenium, on the other hand, focus on automating tasks within web browsers to ensure that websites function as expected from a user's perspective. They can simulate user interactions such as clicks, form submissions, and navigation through pages.\\n\\nThe key differences between REST API testing tools and browser automation tools are:\\n\\n1. **Focus**: REST API testing tools test the backend services and data flow, while browser automation tools focus on the frontend experience.\\n2. **Tooling**: REST API testing often uses tools like Postman, Insomnia, or libraries such as pytest-requests in Python. Browser automation typically employs frameworks like Selenium, Playwright, or Cypress.\\n3. **Environment**: REST API tests are usually performed against a backend server and do not require a full browser environment. Browser automation requires a running web application within a browser.\\n\\nIf you need more detailed information about specific tools or their functionalities, please let me know!\",\n",
